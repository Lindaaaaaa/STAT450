## Self introduction

Fourth year student majored in computer science and statistics. I will be graduate soon. Hope I enjoy my last term at ubc.

# Favouriate equation
My favouraite equation is $Ax=b$ 
Linear algebra is fun, isn't it?


#Favouriate dataset
My favouriate datset is mtcars because I like cars. The dataset is complete and no missing values.

Let's see the details of the dataset.
```{r cars}
x<-data(mtcars)
head(mtcars, 5)
boxplot(mtcars)
```
